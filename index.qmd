## Scientific communication is hard

```{python}
#| echo: false

from helpers import include_shiny_folder

```
::: {.incremental}
- Your findings are complex or nuanced
- People misinterpret things 
- Our understanding of the world is always changing
:::

## Science needs a good framework

::: {.incremental}
- An easy framework which 
- The flexibility to design delightful, intuitive interfaces
- The performance to build demanding data applications 
:::


## Shiny can help

Shiny is an extensible web application written entirely in Python and is ideal for scientific communication:
::: {.incremental}
- Reactive execution makes your app fast
- Dynamic user interfaces make them intuitive
- Custom CSS makes them beautiful
- Modules make them maintainable
